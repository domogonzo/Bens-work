    "text": "FactoryTalk Activation works by binding the license for a Rockwell Automation software product to a specific device, such as a dongle, Ethernet address for a computer, or hard disk drive so that it can be run in a production environment. Once a license is bound the product is activated. Without activation, some Rockwell Automation software products will not run, some will run with diminished functionality, and others will run for a limited period of time and then shut down with or without warning.  The activation is protected by a system-generated signature that is based on machine-specific information that you provide when installing the software. If the signature is tampered with, damaged, or deleted, the software will not function.  Important:  If an activation becomes corrupted, you must rehost the activation to rebind the license with the device.  See also  Types of activations  Supported dongle types  Rehost activations  ",

    "text": "Rockwell Software products offer different activation options. Bound activations to a permanent device on a computer, such as a hard disk or Ethernet card, or to a removable device, such as a dongle.   Node-locked activations  An activation locked to a specific piece of computer hardware and used only on the computer to which it is locked. Examples of computer hardware used for node-locked activation include an Ethernet card, a hard disk, or a dongle. Not all product support node-locked activations. See your product documentation for information on what types of activation it supports.  Concurrent activations  Concurrent activations require a network connection for all computers running Rockwell Automation software. The software automatically connects to a designated activation server on the network and retrieves an activation. Upon shutdown, the software automatically returns the activation to the pool of available activations.  The activation server manages a set number of activations and serves these activations to any configured computer on the network.  Borrowed activations  Borrowed activations are concurrent activation that do not require a continuous network connection and expire after a specified amount of time (borrow term).   Check out a borrowed activation from a pool of activations managed by an activation server. Check out a borrowed activation to a dongle or a computer. Once checked out to the device, the device does not need to maintain connection to the network. When the time limit of the borrowed activation expires, the software is no longer activated on the device where the borrowed activation resides, and the activation automatically becomes available again from the server's activation pool. Borrowing also allows activations to be reserved from the activation pool to be used by a certain computer or group of computers.

This indicated product version will be the latest downloaded product version before performing the partial rehost or renew. This behavior can have adverse effects if activations of different product versions are required, including Rockwell products not being activated and node-locked activations being changed to concurrent activations.   When performing a disconnected rehost for multiple FNP activations of different product versions but the same serial number, the quantities displayed in the # to Rehost and Available columns will not be correct. All of the activations will be removed and entitlements will be returned as expected upon completion of the disconnected rehost steps.  In case of a hard drive crash, contact Rockwell Automation Technical Support.  Do not rehost borrowed activations. If you need to rehost an activation that is currently borrowed, ensure that the activation is returned to the activation server before you rehost the activation.  Rehosting is not intended for moving activations frequently. It is intended to be used only for unexpected or infrequent events such as a computer upgrade or failure, or a change to the system.   Each serial number can be rehosted using the web site up to three times in any 12-month period. Rehosting an activation a fourth time requires a call to Rockwell Automation Technical Support.  Rehosting deletes activation files from the local computer, always run this process on the physical computer where the activation files reside.  For concurrent activations with a quantity greater than 1, there is the option to select a quantity less than the total activations. This leaves a quantity of the activations on the local computer while allowing the rest of the activations to become available for download to other computers. By default, all activations are removed from the local computer. Once an activation is rehosted, borrows of that activation appear in the Find Available Activations table until they expire.

HOST_GROUP Supervisors SupComputer1 &#8212; Creates a computer group called Supervisors that consists of the Windows computer names SupComputer1 through SupComputer5.  RESERVE 3 RS500.exe HOST_GROUP Operators &#8212; Reserves three activations from the available activations for RSLogix 500 for the Operators group. These activations are reserved exclusively for members of the Operators group and cannot be used by computers not in this group.  RESERVE 2 RS500.exe HOST_GROUP Supervisors &#8212; Reserves two activations from the available activations for RSLogix 500 for the Supervisors group. These activations are reserved exclusively for members of the Supervisors group and cannot be used by computers that are not members of the group.  Example  HOST_GROUP Operators OpComputer1 OpComputer2 OpComputer3 \\  OpComputer4 OpComputer5  HOST_GROUP Supervisors SupComputer1 SupComputer2 \\  SupComputer3 SupComputer4 SupComputer5  RESERVE 3 RS500.exe HOST_GROUP Operators  RESERVE 2 RS500.exe HOST_GROUP Supervisors  In this example, the Operators group includes five computers that share three activations. The first three computers that use the software lock the activations available to the group. If there are other activations available that are not reserved on the server, the other members of the Operators computer group can use the activations.
