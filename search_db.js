EXCLUDE and EXCLUDE_BORROW sometimes fail to prevent specific computers and users from borrowing activations  On systems using Flexera, activations are borrowed from a system account. Regardless of which computer logs into the system, Flexera considers the computer a system account, and using an EXCLUDE_BORROW entry in the Flexsvr.opt file does not prevent that computer or a specific user from borrowing an activation.

This behavior is intentional, as the activations are still assigned to the device and are not available for use.

    "url": "254820.htm",
    "text": "The following are the application notes for FactoryTalk Activation Manager.  FactoryTalk Activation Manager version 4.04 supports renewing activations that have changed type from FlexNet to CodeMeter  In FactoryTalk Activation Manager versions 4.04 and later, renewals of activations can include an activation type change from FlexNet to CodeMeter in addition to the expiration date change.  This type change is supported only when the original FlexNet activation is bound to the computer and replaced with a CodeMeter activation bound to the computer.  For dongles, perform a rehost of the original activation and a get of the renewed activation for the activation type. For example, a rehost is necessary when:  Changing from a FlexNet dongle to a CodeMeter dongle  Changing from a CodeMeter dongle to a FlexNet dongle  Activation is bound to a FlexNet dongle, a CodeMeter dongle, or a CodeMeter computer  In FactoryTalk Activation Manager versions 4.02 and later, renewals of activations bound to dongles or computers are supported in which the technology is not changing.  FactoryTalk Activation Manager versions 4.03 and earlier do not support renewing activations that have changed type from FlexNet to CodeMeter  FactoryTalk Activation Manager versions 4.03 and earlier do not renew activations that have changed type from FlexNet to CodeMeter. Rockwell Automation recommends installing version 4.04, which supports renewing activations that have changed type from FlexNet to CodeMeter. If upgrading to version 4.04 is not possible, perform a rehost of the original activation and a get of the renewed activation for the activation type.  FactoryTalk Activation Manager versions on client and server should match to support Subscription Portal License Manager  If upgrading either activation servers or clients from FactoryTalk Activation Manager 4.00 or earlier, upgrade both the servers and clients to FactoryTalk Activation Manager 4.04.     Unavailable activations are listed only on FactoryTalk Activation Manager running on a server   Expired FlexNet activations do not appear on FactoryTalk Activation Manager running on client machines. This behavior is by design, because expired activations cannot be acted upon from a client machine. On FactoryTalk Activation Manager running on a server, activations that are not available, because they have either expired or not yet reached their start date, are displayed as disabled and show a red icon. Hovering over the icon displays a tooltip that explains why the row is disabled.  Rehost expired activations to remove them from the Find Available display.  Removing CodeMeter server address from search path causes errors  After a CM activation is borrowed, removing the CodeMeter server address from the search path on the Update Activation Search Path dialog box on the client PC causes these errors:  The return of the activation fails and this error appears: Borr.010: Server License not found.  In the Borrow date box in the Return Activations table, this text appears: Start time is not available. The source of the borrowed license may not be available.  Date and time settings must match on client and server computers  To borrow CodeMeter activations correctly, the date and time settings of the client and server computers must match within one minute. If the date and time settings do not match, unexpected behavior occurs, such as the failure to activate valid licenses.  Borrowing or returning CodeMeter activations generates only client diagnostic message  Borrowing or returning CodeMeter activations generates only a client diagnostic message. However, borrowing or returning FlexNet Publisher (FNP) activations generates both server and client diagnostic messages.  This is intended behavior.  Updates to server search list  Rockwell Automation recommends using FactoryTalk Activation Manager exclusively to make updates to the server search list. If using CodeMeter Web Admin to update the server search list, the updates may not reflect accurately in the FactoryTalk Activation Manager search list.  Remote Desktop Connection to client computer running Windows Server limits return of activations and activation of products  When using a remote desktop connection to a client computer running a Windows Server operating system, borrowed CodeMeter activations are not displayed, borrowed activations cannot be returned manually (they are automatically returned when they expire), and products relying on the borrowed activation cannot be activated. To work around these limitations, log into the client computer directly. Rockwell Automation recommends not using a Windows Server operating system on a computer that uses borrowed activations or points to a FactoryTalk Activation server.  FactoryTalk Activation Manager is incompatible with Top Server 6 software  For FactoryTalk Activation Manager to operate correctly, Top Server 6 software must be uninstalled, and the FLEXID_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must be removed.  For more information on this issue, see Knowledgebase Document ID: BF14522 FactoryTalk Activation Manager: FTAManager has stopped working.

VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority certificate  If the VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority certificate does not exist on the local computer, the certificate is installed while installing Rockwell Automation software. Use Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to view the certificate in Console Root > Certificates (Local Computer) > Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates.  Unattended or silent install  Use command-line parameters to perform an unattended or silent installation of the software.  Command-line parameters  The following table identifies the installation command-line parameters. Command-line parameters are case-insensitive. However, if a specified value includes a space, be sure to enclose the value in quotation marks (for example, \"value with spaces\").  Parameter  Description  /Q  One of /Q and /QS is required if /Record is not specified.   Installs the product in the silent mode without any user interface.  /QS  One of /Q and /QS is required if /Record is not specified.  Installs the product in the unattended mode without user interaction during installation, and shows the progress, errors, or complete messages on the user interface.  /IAcceptAllLicenseTerms  Required for /Q or /QS.   Specifies that you read and acknowledge all license agreements, and agree to continue the installation.  /AutoRestart  Optional. If specified, the computer restarts automatically after the installation if a restart is required to complete the installation. If a restart is not required, the parameter is ignored.  /SetupLanguage  Optional. Specifies which language is displayed during the install process.  The value must be one of the following:  ENU  CHS  DEU  ESP  FRA  ITA  JPN  KOR  PTB  If this parameter is omitted, the default language is the user or system user interface language.  /Record  Optional. Records inputs to a recording file.  /Playback  Optional. Plays back a recorded file.  /DisableAutoRenew  Optional. If specified, disables the FactoryTalk Activation Manager from automatically connecting to the Rockwell Automation Activation service to query for renewed activations to download. Activations are renewed automatically by default.  Examples  The following examples show how to use the installation commands.  For a silent install with default parameters:  Setup.exe /Q /IAcceptAllLicenseTerms  For an unattended install with customized parameter:  Setup.exe /QS /IAcceptAllLicenseTerms /AutoRestart /SetupLanguage=CHS  For launching an install with the /Record parameter to enter record mode:  Setup.exe /Record  For launching an install with the /Playback parameter to enter playback mode:  Setup.exe /Q /IAcceptAllLicenseTerms /Playback="
